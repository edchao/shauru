The rules of the game are as follows.  You command a squad of 6 characters.  Each character has various abilities from simple walking to ultimate attacks.  Each of these abilities requires different amounts of energy, which regenerates continuously per character over a short span of time.  The goal of the game is to rack up a target number of kills before the opponent does.
